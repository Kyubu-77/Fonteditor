Simple font editor for small pixel fonts with 16bit color palette
Features:
- Save as xml
- Export as cpp file for use with the "Adafruit GFX Graphics Library" 
- Create character from installed font
- Paint a character 
- Add greeble to font (need it for my Arduino matrix screen saver)

Attention: there is no "UNDO" feature

	
Structure:
One font can be edited at the same time. A font consists of several sizes and each size of several characters. Two sizes may have different character sets. 

Workflow:
1. Create font and change name within "Font" group

2. Add size to font, size can be named and sized in the "Size" group

3. Character can now be added in two ways 
   A. To add an empty character 
      - Press the "Add Character button" and paint the character in the "character group"
	  - The color can be selected on the palette
   B. To add a character from a font please proceed with the following steps:
      - Mark the "Active" check box, the "Preview Char" should be visible in the edit box
	  - Adjust the Letter, Font, Size and Offset until the character fits into the red frame.
	  - Once the preview is ok, either add (or overwrite current character) with the "Preview Char" or 
	    add a character range (e.g. a-z)
	  - disable the "preview" check box
	  - the character can also be edit after wards (during preview editing is disabled)

Character sizing
The size of an character can be modified independent from the size setting. There fore just modify the W and H textboxes in the 
"Character group" and press "Resize". I recommend to make copy of the character before.

Palette 
- Foreground and Background for character editing can be changed with help of the palette.
- However, the palette is not stored nor exported (in the cpp file a default grayscale palette is added)
- "Palette up" and "Palette down" adds or decrements 1 from the character pixels half byte.

Greeble
- Adding greeble adds a random value between -2 and +2 to roughly 70% of the charcters pixels
